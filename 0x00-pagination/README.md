Pagination is a sequence of pages which are connected and have similar content.
It is important to note that even when the content on a section of a page is split into distinct pages, we will still define that as pagination.
Why Use Pagination?
 
We have already mentioned a few reasons that necessitate the use of pagination, for example, when there is a large amount of data that can't reasonably be presented as a single page.

Here are more reasons why pagination comes in handy:

Better User Experience
If too much information is published on one page, the user may get overwhelmed. Pagination allows webmasters to present a lot of information in small and manageable chunks.

E-commerce sites will show the product’s image and price on the home page for example.

If a user is interested in more details about the product, they can click on the image/price/link with a call to action to learn more. Pagination also makes it easier for a user to find the information they are looking for.

Easier Navigation
In our earlier example, Influence on YouTube, their pagination example is a CTA. It can help make navigation easier for the user who wants to go through the course.

Pagination aids in navigation even when CTAs are not used. Once the user reaches the end of the page or has seen several items in a particular category,  it is intuitive that they will want to see more results.
Where numbering is used, the user is able to decide how many more pages they are willing to look at. It also gives them an idea of how big the data set is. A large data set may be appealing to a user looking for variety.

Note that it is best practice to always use CTAs.

How Does Pagination Impact SEO?
Pagination without a doubt helps create a great user experience. But does it positively or negatively impact SEO?

Affects Your Site’s Crawling by Search Engine Bots
When it comes to sites with a lots of pages, bot crawlers have to determine what content on the site they need to crawl, how frequently they need to crawl the site, and the resources that the site’s server can allocate to the crawling process.

 In comes the crawl budget concept.

When your site has large amounts of data, search engine bots need to use their crawl budget wisely. They need to choose what content to crawl, and how often. This means that there is a likelihood that some of your content will neither be crawled nor indexed.

There is also a likelihood that the crawl budget will be spent on the pages that the pagination directs to, and other significant pages may never be crawled nor indexed.

What does this mean then?

After implementing pagination on your site, you need to prioritize the most important pages on your home page, or on the page where pagination begins. An example here would be a search engine like Google.

The most relevant search results are on page one. This way, your crawl budget will be spent on your best content. Once users are on your site, then they have the opportunity to interact with other pages as structured by your pagination.

It may Result in the Creation of ‘Thin’ Content
There are cases where pagination can result in the creation of ‘thin’ content. This is when the content offers little value to the user, if any. Thin content could also result from a page with little content, and scraped and spinner content too.

If you split content types as a single article spread across multiple pages, you may end up with pages with little content. Search engine bots simply will not rank thin content. They want content that is valuable to the user, and answers a user’s intent.

It may Result in the Creation of Duplicate Content
If you have an e-commerce site, for example, there is a possibility that all your product pages have the same structure and content that is similar, with the exception of a particular product’s specific details.

In the Oscar Hunt example above, all the items shown in the image belong to one product category. They have similar descriptions apart from their color and pattern.

They are also likely to have similarities in their on-page SEO, for example, meta descriptions, h1 tags, anchor text, CTAs, and page titles.

Search engine bots may not be able to ‘tell’ that the pages with similar content actually represent different products. They may choose to crawl some of the pages and ignore some. In worst cases, they may flag your site for duplicate content.

It Dilutes Ranking Signals
Pagination may make a site’s ranking signals weaker. A good example here is backlinks. When sites with high site authority link to your site, it is an indicator that your site is also high authority.

Such sites will pass their authority to your site. However, if your site uses pagination, this authority will be split across pages, and become ‘diluted’ as a result.
How to Correctly Implement Pagination
 
Google recently announced that they have not used rel = ”next” and rel = ”prev” in years and that they would no longer support it. This was one of the most commonly used markups to let search engine bots know that particular pages are paginated.
While this has caused different reactions among SEOs, it has also emphasized the need to correctly implement pagination.
In order to ensure that your site correctly implements pagination, it is important to test how it is currently being implemented. This way, you get to know what specifically needs fixing.
Testing Your Site for Current Pagination Implementation
There are different types of tools that you need in your pagination test arsenal:
Inspect Element to Test for Similarity in Your Paginated Pages
 Right-click to access the Inspect Element. CTRL F and type in "canonical". You should be able to see rel="canonical" href="the url of the current page"
